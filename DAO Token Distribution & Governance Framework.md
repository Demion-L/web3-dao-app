## Governance Rules & Voting Mechanisms

### Voting Power System

**1. Token-Based Voting**

- 1 MTK = 1 Vote
- Minimum 1,000 MTK to create proposals
- Tokens must be delegated to participate in voting

**2. Delegation System**

- Members can delegate voting power to trusted representatives
- Self-delegation required to vote directly
- Delegation can be changed at any time

### Proposal Types & Requirements

#### **1. Standard Proposals**

- **Quorum**: 4% of total supply (40,000 MTK)
- **Approval**: Simple majority (>50%)
- **Voting Period**: 7 days
- **Examples**:
  - Community initiatives
  - Small treasury expenditures (<10,000 MTK)
  - Non-critical parameter changes

#### **2. Significant Proposals**

- **Quorum**: 10% of total supply (100,000 MTK)
- **Approval**: 60% majority
- **Voting Period**: 10 days
- **Examples**:
  - Large treasury expenditures (>50,000 MTK)
  - Contract upgrades
  - Major partnership agreements

#### **3. Constitutional Proposals**

- **Quorum**: 20% of total supply (200,000 MTK)
- **Approval**: 75% supermajority
- **Voting Period**: 14 days
- **Examples**:
  - Governance rule changes
  - Token economics modifications
  - Core mission changes

### Proposal Lifecycle

**1. Discussion Phase (3-7 days)**

- Community discussion on forums
- Proposal refinement
- Feedback collection

**2. Formal Submission**

- On-chain proposal creation
- Required deposit: 5,000 MTK (refunded if proposal passes)
- Technical review period

**3. Voting Phase**

- Active voting period (7-14 days depending on type)
- Real-time results visible
- Vote delegation allowed

**4. Execution Phase**

- Automatic execution via TimeLock (24-48 hour delay)
- Implementation monitoring
- Results reporting

### Governance Safeguards

**1. Time Delays**

- **Standard proposals**: 24-hour execution delay
- **Significant proposals**: 48-hour execution delay
- **Constitutional proposals**: 72-hour execution delay

**2. Emergency Procedures**

- **Emergency pause**: Can halt critical functions
- **Requires**: 25% of total supply voting within 24 hours
- **Duration**: Maximum 7 days

**3. Proposal Limits**

- **Per address**: Maximum 3 active proposals
- **Minimum interval**: 48 hours between proposals from same address
- **Spam protection**: Increasing deposit requirements for rapid submissions

### Incentive Mechanisms

**1. Governance Participation Rewards**

- **Delegation rewards**: 5 MTK per month for active delegates

**2. Quality Incentives**

- **Constructive discussion**: Community recognition tokens
- **Code contributions**: Technical contribution bounties

### Anti-Gaming Measures

**1. Vote Buying Protection**

- **Minimum hold period**: 7 days before tokens can vote
- **Snapshot-based voting**: Voting power determined at proposal creation
- **Delegation cooldown**: 24-hour delay for delegation changes

**2. Sybil Resistance**

- **Reputation system** based on participation history
- **Progressive voting power**: Diminishing returns for large holdings

### Governance Evolution
