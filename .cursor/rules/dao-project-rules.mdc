In this project I'm using Solidity ^0.8.24, Foundry for testing, Sepolia as a testnet. My contracts separately placed in a /contracts folder, tests, scripts e.g I keep in /foundry folder on same level with /contracts folder. My front-end part I keep in /src folder on same level with /contracts and /foundry. For front-end I'm using Next.js with Redux.
