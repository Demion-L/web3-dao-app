# DAO Voting Frontend

This project implements a frontend for a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) voting system, built on top of OpenZeppelin's governance contracts.

## Overview

The system is built using OpenZeppelin's modular governance system, which allows for flexible and customizable on-chain voting protocols. The implementation includes:

### Core Components

1. **Governor Contract**

   - Core contract containing all governance logic and primitives
   - Abstract contract that requires implementation of specific modules
   - Handles proposal creation, voting, and execution

2. **Voting Modules**

   - `GovernorVotes`: Extracts voting weight from an IVotes contract
   - `GovernorVotesQuorumFraction`: Sets quorum as a fraction of total token supply
   - `GovernorVotesSuperQuorumFraction`: Implements super quorum functionality

3. **Counting Modules**
   - `GovernorCountingSimple`: Basic voting with 3 options (Against, For, Abstain)
   - `GovernorCountingFractional`: Advanced voting allowing partial voting power allocation
   - `GovernorCountingOverridable`: Extended version allowing delegate overrides

### Key Features

1. **Voting System**

   - Configurable voting delay and period
   - Flexible quorum requirements
   - Support for different voting mechanisms
   - Vote delegation capabilities

2. **Security Features**

   - Reentrancy protection
   - Access control mechanisms
   - Timelock functionality for proposal execution

3. **Token Integration**
   - ERC-20 token support for voting power
   - Token delegation system
   - Vote tracking and history

## Technical Details

### Voting Process

1. **Proposal Creation**

   - Proposals can be created by token holders
   - Each proposal includes targets, values, and calldata
   - Proposals require a minimum threshold of voting power

2. **Voting Period**

   - Configurable delay before voting starts
   - Set duration for voting period
   - Quorum requirements must be met

3. **Execution**
   - Successful proposals can be executed after voting period
   - Optional timelock delay for execution
   - Execution through timelock controller

### Configuration Options

- `votingDelay()`: Time between proposal submission and voting start
- `votingPeriod()`: Duration of the voting period
- `quorum()`: Required voting power for proposal success
- `proposalThreshold()`: Minimum voting power to create proposals

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Foundry
- Solidity ^0.8.20

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
forge test
```

## Security Considerations

- All governance functions require proper access control
- Timelock delays should be carefully configured
- Quorum requirements should be set appropriately
- Consider using OpenZeppelin's security features
